university homework
the original code is here : http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599/01wi/admin/Assignments/hopfield.html.
we must add code for "sychronous" updating,
just a litle adds on the original code and its working fine for me.(or maybe i think so!!!!!) 
i used Netbeans 8.0.2, some comments are in Greek!!! 
its a "all time classic" Homework for Hellenic Open University, in the Artificial Intellingence class (PLI 31), in Computer science Departement.
